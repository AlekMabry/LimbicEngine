# Limbic Engine
A game engine for a game I am working on: Outpost 731. Currently it is being developed as a PC game for steam, however I am keeping the resource requirements very low so that it can be run on my handheld arm-based console. I'm also planning on adding VR support in the future.

The levels/maps for the game can be made in Hammer 3.4. Limbic supports BSP file formats from Quake 2/GoldSource games. It also supports WAD2/WAD3 file format for map textures.

## Setup Guide
The engine files are split up into two different parts: engine code and assets. All of the actual game assets (maps, textures, shaders, models, ect.) are stored in the outpost731 folder, which you can download and place into your executable directory here:
